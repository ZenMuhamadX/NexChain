# Nexchain Core Integration/Staging

## What is Nexchain Core?
Nexchain is a new generation decentralized blockchain designed to provide a simple, secure, and transparent transaction platform. Nexchain Core connects to the Nex peer-to-peer network, allowing users to efficiently download and validate blocks and transactions.

## License
Nexchain Core is released under the MIT license. For more information, please see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file or visit the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

## Development Process
The development of Nexchain Core follows a collaborative process, where contributors can submit pull requests (PR) for review. We encourage developers to maintain clear commit messages and provide comprehensive documentation for new features or changes introduced.

### Key Steps in the Development Process:
1. **Feature Development:** Developers implement new features or fixes.
2. **Pull Request Submission:** Once development is complete, a pull request is created for review.
3. **Code Review:** Other contributors review the code for quality, security, and adherence to project standards.
4. **Testing:** The code must be thoroughly tested before merging.

## Testing
Testing and code review are crucial stages in our development cycle, as they help maintain the integrity and security of the Nexchain network. Given the high volume of pull requests, your patience and cooperation in testing others' submissions are greatly appreciated.

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing
It is important for changes to be tested by individuals other than the original developer. This practice minimizes bias and helps catch potential issues early. For major or high-risk changes, please consider the following:

- **Testing Plan:** Include a detailed testing plan in the pull request description, explaining how the changes should be tested.
- **Documentation:** Document testing procedures, expected results, and potential edge cases to consider.

By following these guidelines, we can ensure that Nexchain Core remains a secure and reliable platform for all users.
